# interaction-products

This is my attempts to generate useful interaction permutations between disperate things.

Please see [samsquire/ideas5 350. Structured interaction programming: Trying to restrict interaction complexity and implement arbitrary software composability of abstractions](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas5#350-structured-interaction-programming-trying-to-restrict-interaction-complexity-and-implement-arbitrary-software-composability-of-abstractions) for a full explanation.
